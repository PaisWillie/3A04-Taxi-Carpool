# Cabpool

## About

Cabpool is a React Native mobile app that allows users to create and join carpools to get to their destination.
It is designed as an additional feature for local taxi services to offer their customers.

This app was created as a final project for SFWRENG 3A04: Software Design II at McMaster University, through the process
of generating software requirements, and implementing them in a software architecture.

Requirements include:

- [x] Interfacing with Google Maps to allow customers to track the taxi route
- [x] Present potential routes when requesting or offering taxi carpools
- [x] Encrypt all transmitted messages using a cryptosystem for confidentiality and integrity purposes
